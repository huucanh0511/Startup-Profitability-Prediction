# 🚀 Profitable Startup Prediction 📈

Welcome to the "Startup-Profitability-Prediction" repository! This project focuses on predicting startup profitability using a combination of Logistic Regression and Random Forest models. By analyzing various financial, market, and operational factors, this project aims to provide insights into the potential success of startups.

## Overview

In this project, we explore the predictive power of financial metrics (such as funding amount, funding rounds, revenue), market indicators (market share), and operational statistics (startup age, employee count) on the profitability of startups. By utilizing machine learning techniques like Logistic Regression and Random Forest, we evaluate key performance metrics like AUC, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, we address common issues like underfitting, overfitting, and feature selection to ensure the robustness of our models.

## Key Features

🔍 **Financial Analysis:** Dive deep into the financial aspects of startups to understand how funding rounds, amounts, and revenue impact their profitability.

📊 **Market Insights:** Explore the significance of market share in predicting the success of startups in various industries.

⏱️ **Operational Factors:** Analyze operational metrics like startup age and employee count to uncover their influence on profitability.

🧠 **Machine Learning Models:** Utilize Logistic Regression and Random Forest algorithms to build predictive models based on the dataset provided.

📊 **Performance Evaluation:** Assess the performance of the models using metrics like AUC, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
